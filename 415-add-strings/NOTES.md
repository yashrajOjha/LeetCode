Very similar to Add Two Numbers question, while loop until x(len of string 1) and y(len of string 2) are >= 0 or carry >0, if x>=0 store the value in another variable ```n1=num1.charAt(x--)-'0';```, if y>=0 store the value into another variable ```n2=num2.charAt(y--)-'0';```, add these two variables with carry, make carry as sum/10 and append sum%10 into the string builder. Return the reverse string.
