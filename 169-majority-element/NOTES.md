Boyer Moore voting algorithm is used to find the majority element among the given sequence of elements which occurs more than N/2 times, in linear time complexity and constant space complexity.
​
Here's a diagram to explain the sequence we will follow.
​
Let's assume an array of the following elements, by counting we can say the majority element is 7, but let's see how the voting algorithm works.
