So a simple method is to store inorder traversal of the input tree in an auxiliary array. Sort the auxiliary array. Finally, insert the auxiliary array elements back to the BST, keeping the structure of the BST same. The time complexity of this method is O(nLogn) and the auxiliary space needed is O(n).
