We are given a rod of size ‘N’. It can be cut into pieces. Each length of a piece has a particular price given by the price array. Our task is to find the maximum revenue that can be generated by selling the rod after cutting( if required) into pieces.

```
Input:
N = 8
Price[] = {1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20}
Output:
22
Explanation:
The maximum obtainable value is 22 by
cutting in two pieces of lengths 2 and 
6, i.e., 5+17=22.
