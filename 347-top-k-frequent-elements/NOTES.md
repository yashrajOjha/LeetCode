Approach: The thought process should begin from creating a HashMap to store element-frequency pair in the HashMap. HashMap is used to perform insertion and updation in constant time. Then sort the element-frequency pair in decreasing order of frequency. This gives the information about each element and the number of times they are present in the array. To get k elements of the array, store the first k elements of the sorted list.
