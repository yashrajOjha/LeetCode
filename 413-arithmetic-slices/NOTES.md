* "curr" the number of different "Arithmetic Slices" ends at index = i
* a small example :
we have :[1, 2, 3, 4]
index = 2, we have curr = 1, sum = 1, which is [1,2,3];
index = 3, curr = 2, sum = 2 + 1 = 3; because we look back from index = 3 which is 4 , we will have two "Arithmetic Slices", which is [2,3,4] and [1,2,3,4]
